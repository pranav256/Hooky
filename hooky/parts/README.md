# Story parts

An export-only subproject for turning a narrated long-form video into a
condensed, chronological series of vertical parts.

## Run

From the repository root, after the main project's setup:

```bash
./hooky.sh parts story.mp4
./hooky.sh parts 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID'
./hooky.sh parts story.mp4 --part-seconds 60 --labels
./hooky.sh parts story.mp4 --caption-file story.srt --dry-run
```

Python: `.venv/bin/hooky-parts story.mp4`.
Installed command: `hooky-parts story.mp4`.

For cartoons, episodes, or any source where Gemini should find the funniest
moments and the export should contain only numeric overlays, use the
number-only variant:

```bash
./hooky.sh number-parts cartoon.mp4
./hooky.sh parts cartoon.mp4 --mode number-only --part-seconds 60
```

It runs Gemini over the source to find funny, surprising, absurd, reaction,
visual-gag, and punchline moments, keeps those selected ranges in source order,
and packs them into roughly 60-second parts. It skips Whisper and subtitles,
then burns only the numeric marker `1`, `2`, `3`, and so on. The full frame is
preserved over the selected blurred or plain vertical background. It is still
export-only and never queues to Instagram.

## Defaults

- AI decides retained story length from the evidence.
- Retain setup, stakes, developments, causal context, and payoff in source order.
- Remove sponsors, repeated explanations, and filler.
- Preserve original footage and audio.
- Aim for 60 seconds per part; prefer sentence endings/edit joins and stay
  below the 90-second hard limit.
- Fit the entire source picture into 1080x1920 over a blurred background.
- Burn existing karaoke subtitles, remapped onto the edited timeline.
- Export files under `output/parts/<source-id>/` and preserve the input video.

`--mode number-only` changes these defaults to: use Gemini's content-based funny
moment selection, skip Whisper/caption subtitle timing, force subtitles off,
and burn numeric labels only. `PARTS_MODE=number-only` can make that variant
the default for `hooky-parts`.

## Options

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--part-seconds N` | Target duration; defaults to `PARTS_TARGET_SECONDS=60`. |
| `--mode story\|number-only` | AI condensed story or Gemini-selected funny moments with numeric-only overlays. |
| `--background blur\|plain` | Blurred backdrop or lighter plain padding; defaults to `PARTS_BACKGROUND=blur`. |
| `--labels` | Visible `Part N / Total` label in the upper padding. |
| `--caption-file FILE` | Use a specific VTT/SRT track as spoken evidence. |
| `--subtitle-source auto\|source\|whisper` | Prefer captions, require captions, or regenerate retained subtitle timing. |
| `--sub-style NAME` | Existing `hormozi`, `clean`, or `yellow` subtitle styles. |
| `--sub-lang LANG` | Whisper language hint. |
| `--no-subs` | Export without burned-in subtitles. |
| `--dry-run` | Write the story and parts plan before rendering. |
| `--out DIR` | Choose an export directory. |
| `--profile` | Write stage timings to `profile.json`. |

Story mode still needs spoken evidence with `--no-subs`. It uses available
caption tracks first, or caches independently transcribed five-minute Whisper
windows when captions are missing. Caption cue timing is interpolated across
words; explicit Whisper timing costs more CPU but can improve alignment.
Number-only mode bypasses Whisper and subtitle timing, but it still runs Gemini
because the point of the variant is to find the best funny moments.

## Outputs and recovery

`story_plan.json` contains Gemini's selected source ranges and each part's source
fragments, edited-timeline boundaries, and fragment offsets. `manifest.json`
lists completed exports and final completion status. MP4s use names such as
`part_001.mp4`; subtitle-enabled exports include a corresponding ASS sidecar.

Rerun the same command after interruption. Selection requests, speech windows,
rendered fragments, and completed parts have versioned checkpoints keyed by
their source/options. Each fragment encodes sequentially, then the final part
is assembled with stream copy. Validated completed parts release their
temporary assembly fragments. Blurring runs at 480p before scaling up.

## Modules

- `cli.py` / `__main__.py`: local-file and single-URL entry points.
- `options.py`: validated parts options.
- `planner.py`: AI story beats, chronology, timeline mapping, and part boundaries.
- `renderer.py`: resumable per-fragment encoding and final assembly.
- `pipeline.py`: evidence acquisition, checkpoints, manifests, and export orchestration.

Shared utilities live in `hooky/core/`; this subproject uses the main `.env`
and its Gemini, download authentication, encoding, and Whisper settings.
